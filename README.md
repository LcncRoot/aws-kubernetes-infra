# AWS Kubernetes Infrastructure

## **Project Overview**
This repository demonstrates a **fully automated, scalable Kubernetes infrastructure** deployed on AWS. It is designed as **practical cloud-native architecture**, serving as a template for future use cases, leveraging:

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for cluster management
- **Helm** for Kubernetes package management
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for monitoring (planned)
- **AI-powered Log Anomaly Detection** (future implementation)

This is not intended reductively as a local development playgroundâ€”it is a intended as a production-ready cloud-native environment.

## **Current Project Status**
### âœ… **Completed**
âœ” **Terraform-based AWS Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - VPC with public subnets
   - IAM roles and security policies
   - AWS EKS control plane successfully provisioned

âœ” **EKS Cluster Deployment**
   - `terraform apply` successfully created an **ACTIVE** Kubernetes control plane

### âš  **In Progress**
ðŸ”¸ **Fixing EKS Node Group Creation Issues**
   - Node instances are failing to join the cluster due to IAM and networking misconfigurations.
   - **Solution:** Ensure worker nodes have proper IAM permissions and a valid security group configuration.

### ðŸ”œ **Next Steps**
ðŸ”¹ **Verify Kubernetes Cluster is Fully Functional**
   - Deploy a simple pod or application to confirm cluster health.
   - Validate with `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl get pods -A`.

ðŸ”¹ **Implement CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Set up **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployments.

ðŸ”¹ **Deploy AI-Powered Log Anomaly Detection**
   - Develop and containerize an ML-based anomaly detection service.
   - Integrate with Prometheus for log ingestion and alerting.

## **How to Set Up Locally**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LcncRoot/aws-kubernetes-infra.git
   cd aws-kubernetes-infra
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**
   ```sh
   sudo apt install awscli terraform kubectl helm -y
   ```

3. **Authenticate AWS CLI**
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform**
   ```sh
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Deploy Kubernetes Apps via Helm** *(Once cluster is stable)*
   ```sh
   helm install my-app ./charts/my-app
   ```

## **Long-Term Vision**
This project is intended to serve as a **complete cloud-native DevOps environment**, with plans to:
âœ… Integrate **AI-powered log anomaly detection** for proactive incident response.
âœ… Automate CI/CD pipelines for **seamless Kubernetes deployments**.
âœ… Implement **observability tooling** (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana).
âœ… Showcase a **real-world production architecture**.

### **Why This Matters**
This project is not just about deploying a home Kubernetes clusterâ€”itâ€™s about demonstrating **true DevOps automation, scalability, and cloud-native best practices**. If youâ€™re an employer reviewing this, youâ€™ll find that I can design, build, and manage **highly available, production-ready infrastructure**.
